        <p>Every coding project starts off with thorough research, finding new and accessible features to incorporate to the final piece. Coding projects range from web design to interactive installations. Typical programs I use are Visual Studio Code, Max MSP, Arduino, or Processing (P5JS). Follow along with my work on <a class="link-white-bg--orange" href="https://www.instagram.com/daizziestudio/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p>

            <summary>Funhouse Game</summary>
            <p>The Funhouse is a never-ending game that requires two players. In a long wooden box there are openings for two heads to be placed inside. At the other end is a monitor with a video on loop. You two have to work together to make the video play at the right frame rate with the right colors to win. Be quick! The correct values change every 15-30 seconds.</p>

            <summary>Leap Motion Water Projection</summary>
            <p>I've always been interested on water projections and wanted to make it interactive. I had learned about leap motion recently and its ability to track hands and specific fingers. This mini-project was an exploration into the two realms. Users could draw with stars or push around planets.</p>

            <summary>CuddlePants</summary>
            <p>What started off as a joke is one of my favorite projects. At the time of its conception I had learned about professional cuddlers and wanted to create a contrast to such intimate human connection. The user wears a pair of sweats with a pillow on it. Someone lies down and rests their head on the users lap and when they do, a mechanical arm comes out to stroke their head, keeping the users hands free to be on their phone or read.</p>
